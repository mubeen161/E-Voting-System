Problem Statement:
In the current landscape of democratic processes, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) face challenges related to political interference, lengthy voting procedures, and potential user unfamiliarity with technology. The hackathon challenge is to design a secure and efficient voting system that addresses these issues. Key objectives include mitigating political interference through robust encryption, streamlining the voting process to reduce time, creating a user-friendly interface for mobile and web applications, ensuring transparency in the voting mechanism, and integrating secure methods for voters to cast their votes through digital platforms.The goal is to foster innovation and develop a voting system that is both secure and accessible, meeting the demands of modern democratic elections.

Solution:
The proposed online voting system redefines modern democratic processes, overcoming challenges linked to traditional Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). It features a dynamic, multilingual homepage for widespread accessibility, with an "Announcements" section for voting schedules and a "News" section for political updates. A "Guidance" section aids new voters, and a "Parties" section presents political entities. Notably, the "Voting System for Elderly" ensures inclusivity by assisting those unable to visit polling booths.

The "Vote Now" option initiates a secure authentication process using face and fingerprint recognition, coupled with a unique voter ID and password. A detailed candidate list allows informed decision-making, with a unique review option for transparency. Once submitted, votes are irrevocable, preserving the electoral process's sanctity. This innovative online voting solution surpasses the stated challenges, incorporating biometric authentication and a review feature, setting a new standard for secure, efficient, and user-friendly democratic elections.
